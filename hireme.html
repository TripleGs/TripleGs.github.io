                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am the TripleG, the creator of ImagineTTRPGs. </p>
                <p>I am personally known as a recently engaged man about to
                    graduate university and begin vanlife.</p>
                <h2>How I Got Here</h2>
                <p>I started making TTRPG content shortly after I was introduced to
                    Dungeons and Dragons in 2017, and have since the developed my own
                    simple TTRPGs and homebrew content for a variety of TTRPGs.</p>
                <p>I created this website as a way to share my TTRPG content
                    with the world, and to learn how to code a website from
                    scratch. Though I learned a lot from university, there was
                    still a lot to learn. This website was a way that I could
                    combine both of my passions together and learn along the way.</p>
