                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Joseph Goss and I am a 2024 grad of Lebanon Valley College (LVC). I graduated with a degree in 
                    computer science and a minor in political science. I enjoy playing dungeons and dragons, creating TTRPG content, 
                    creating music, playing guitar, coding, and exploring the outdoors. 
                </p>
                <h2>What I'm Doing Now</h2>
                <p>Right now I am trying to take the skills I learned from university and apply those to the real world while searching for a job. Though the job market is scarce right now, I'm not going to prevent that
                    from using my degree to make some money, one of the perks of programming is that I can make practically anything digital, so I am apply that to my hobbies to make some money
                    while in search of a more stable form of income. 
                </p>
                <h2>What I Plan To Do</h2>
                <p>My plans for the future are to renovate a van with my fianc√©, soon to be wife and travel across the country and explore it while we are young.
                    When vanlife is cheaper than an apartment, it's hard to refute saving money while explore the country when the only other alternative is living in a concrete box.
